* nitrox://  URL handling to open/download new app - security issues?
  - should support extensible URL types for different kinds of apps, and passing
    these URL requests into the app.  e.g.
      1) boot up the appropriate Nitrox instance
      2) load the app
      3) wait for the app to initialize any URL handlers
      4) pass in the URL request at that time (or keep it in queue, and let the app request it)

* pass src file URL into nitrox when loading a page (if window.location.href is wrong,
  which it may no longer be)
* file upload API
* view management?  (size, opacity, etc)
* app.exit that just exits the current window/app versus whole app - switch?
* history and back button support (native goBack/goForward don't work with current loading system)
* restore multi-app support - e.g., having multiple open NitroxWebViews, each with its own
  data and context.
  Will probably need a single HTTP server on a known port for <script> tags and HTML links,
  and a dynamic one (or a hierarchy of sub-delegates, e.g. http://mainserver/app/<APPID>/rpc/...)
* position:fixed emulation using native UIKit widgets?

DONE:

* function to change app/page
